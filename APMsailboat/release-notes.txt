Todo:
-Implement AP_Anemometer
-Implement calc_sail_trim in auto mode
-When loitering (_WPcircle == true), loose the sails!
-Fix LogFile.cpp:781 type mismatch
-Remove HOLD 'in irons' references (not using HOLD mode for pausing, using Loitering in AUTO mode)


Notes:
-Tacking Navigator logic (AP_L2_Control) is an implementation of AP_Navigation (like AP_L1_Control). 
	To operate, it uses an instance of AP_L1_Control for all the 'heavy lifting', but choosing when to navigate to a waypoint, and when to navigate along a bearing.
-'Loitering' for a sailboat means: while within radius, point into the wind ('in irons') and fully release the sails.
